Our VR Classroom project revolutionizes education by creating an immersive virtual environment tailored for introverted students. It integrates real-time instruction from a live teacher with AI-driven assistance, allowing students to engage in lessons without fear of judgment. The AI uses natural language processing to interact with students and perform sentiment analysis, evaluating their confidence levels based on their responses. Customizable virtual scenes, such as serene parks or beaches, provide a calming atmosphere, enhancing focus and reducing anxiety. This innovative approach fosters greater participation, personalized learning, and confidence building, creating a supportive and effective educational experience for all students.
